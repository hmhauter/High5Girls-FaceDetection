# High5Girls-FaceDetection

## Introduction
This is the code base for a workshop for Face Detection and Face Recognition. <br>
1. Setting up of the Python environment. <br>
2. First we will get familiar with Python in the **Start** folder. <br>
3. Then we will see how good the Face Detection works in the **FaceDetection** folder. <br>
4. Last we will go through Face Recognition by ceating our own dataset and training a Neural Network to recognize our faces n the **FaceRecognition** folder.

## Installation

1.  We will set up the conda environment together. The miniconda environment can be installed here: 
- Linux: [Installing on Linux — conda 23.1.0 documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html)
- Windows: [Installing on Windows — conda 23.1.0 documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/windows.html)
- macOS: [Installing on macOS — conda 23.1.0 documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/macos.html) <br>
The environment can be created with `conda create -n high5girls python=3.10`
2.  Activate the environment via `conda activate high5girls`
3.  Run `conda install pip`
4.  Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python packages.
